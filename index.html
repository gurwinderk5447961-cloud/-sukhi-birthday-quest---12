<strong>💌 Dear Sukhi 💖,</strong>

You are the second girl—after my mom—for whom I’ve ever written a letter like this. That alone should tell you how deeply you live in my heart.

Today is your birthday—but to me, it’s more than just a celebration of the day you were born. It’s a celebration of every moment you’ve made brighter, every smile you’ve shared, and every heartbeat that’s echoed in mine since you came into my life.

Sukhi, I love you.

I still remember the day I first saw you in 8th class. You were sitting there, unaware of how deeply you'd imprint yourself on my heart. That moment—it was quiet, but powerful. A feeling I’ve never forgotten.

Then came the day I saw Yuvraj ask you to be Ishwinder’s girlfriend. I didn’t know what to do with the ache in my chest. I stayed silent, but inside, I was breaking. Not because I was angry—but because I realized how much you meant to me. Even when I couldn’t say it, even when I had to watch from a distance… you were everything.

I tried to forget you. I told myself I had to. I was angry—angry at myself, at the situation, at the silence between us. But then one day, Ishu, Lovepreet, and I were talking, and they teased me, saying you were looking at me. I knew they were joking, but they also knew the truth: how I felt about you, even when I tried to hide it.

As we moved into 9th and 10th class, I thought those feelings had faded. I felt normal around you. I convinced myself that I had nothing left in my heart. But then came that moment—when Lovepreet spilled water on your face, and I saw you crying. Something inside me snapped. I was furious. And when you left the class, Lovepreet and I started fighting. I didn’t even know why. But in that moment, I realized: my feelings hadn’t disappeared. They had grown with me.

So I started creating distance. Not because I didn’t care—but because I cared too much. And when you began talking to Amit, I felt something I hadn’t expected: jealousy. It hit me hard. But by the time we reached 11th class, I had learned to quiet my heart. I told myself, “I’m not for her.” And maybe that’s true.

But even now, even after all this time, I want you to know something I’ve never said out loud:

Sukhi, I love you. I always have.

I know you may never read this whole letter. I know you may never feel the same. But this is my truth, and I needed you to hear it—even if only once.

Forever yours,  
Prince 💖
